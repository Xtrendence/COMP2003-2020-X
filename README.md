### Project Vision

BRIMS Self-Management Software is a cross-platform mobile app that acts as a daily diary for those who suffer from Multiple Sclerosis. The aim of this project is to regularly monitor the patient, how regularly they fall/lose balance and by retaining this information it can be charted, and trends can be identified, which ultimately allows for a progression of degradation to be found for each individual user. This software also provides a web-based admin interface which allows the researchers to analyze incoming data, export it to Excel, and view graphs of the data. It would also provide [full CRUD functionality](http://web.socem.plymouth.ac.uk/COMP2003/COMP2003_X/api/).
